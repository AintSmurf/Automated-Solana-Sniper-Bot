## Overview  

**Automated Solana Sniper Bot (v3.2.0)** is a modular, database-backed system for real-time token detection (Helius), automated trading (Jupiter), and position management (with live tracking, exit rules, and UI dashboard).  

The system has evolved from CSV-based simulation to full **SQL persistence**, enabling advanced analytics, smoother UI integration, and fault-tolerant trade recovery.

### Architecture Highlights
- **Detection layer** ‚Äî Helius WebSocket stream + transaction analysis  
- **Execution layer** ‚Äî Jupiter-powered trading via `TraderManager`  
- **Persistence layer** ‚Äî PostgreSQL via `SqlDBUtility`, `TradeDAO`, `SignatureDAO`, `TokenDAO`  
- **Tracking layer** ‚Äî DB-aware `OpenPositionTracker` with exit rules (TP / SL / TSL / Timeout)  
- **UI layer** ‚Äî Tkinter-based dashboard (`SniperBotUI`) with live table view and manual controls  
- **Orchestration** ‚Äî `BotOrchestrator` wires all services, manages async tasks and shutdown

## Important Notes

- Make sure `bot_settings.json` is properly configured before using `--server` mode.
- Your private key and API keys are loaded from environment variables or `.env`/JSON securely.
- All trades in **simulation** unless you explicitly disable `SIM_MODE` in the settings.
- SIM_MODE still connects to mainnet and fetches real Jupiter quotes, so price and output values are accurate
  - Difference: it does not broadcast a transaction or spend SOL.
  - Instead, it logs a SIMULATED_BUY to CSV with calculated entry price and tokens received.
  - slippage and mevbot not included so pnl will be abit off
- Use mainnet only when ready for real trading; devnet is for testing only
- Post-buy Tracking implemented  but not integrated yet under testing

## New in 3.2.0

-  **PostgreSQL integration**  
  - Persistent `trades`, `signatures`, and `tokens` tables  
  - Reconnects automatically and rolls back failed inserts safely  
  - Each trade stores entry/exit USD, PnL%, trigger reason, timestamps  

-  **DAO Layer**  
  - `TradeDAO`, `SignatureDAO`, and `TokenDAO` isolate DB logic  
  - Unique signature tracking for each simulated or real trade  
  - Prevents duplicates using safe UPSERT pattern  

- **UI Overhaul (`SniperBotUI`)**  
  - Responsive layout with separate Live & Closed Panels  
  - Real-time refresh (wallets, APIs, trades)  
  - Start / Stop / Settings / Refresh controls  
  - Manual close for open trades directly from UI  

-  **New LoggingPanel**  
  - Thread-safe queue updates  
  - Live filtering + hover highlighting  
  - ‚ùå *Close Trade* action column  
  - Instant removal of sold tokens  

-  **Improved Simulation Mode**  
  - Every simulated trade gets unique signature (`SIMULATED_BUY_<timestamp>`)  
  - No duplicate key errors  
  - Uniform handling across real & simulated pipelines  

-  **Better Exit Rule Evaluation**  
  - All open trades are synced from database  
  - Timeout, trailing stop, and TP logic are time-aware (UTC)  
  - Clean removal after sell or timeout exit

## Config Files Overview  


| File | Purpose |  
|------|---------|  
| `config/bot_settings.py` | Core parameters (TP/SL, liquidity threshold, SIM mode, rate limits) |  
| `config/dex_detection_rules.py` | Per-DEX rules for token validation |

---
### Credentials & Secrets

The bot requires several private credentials (Helius API key, SOL private key, Discord bot token, optional BirdEye key). These should be provided via environment variables, a local `credentials.sh`/PowerShell script, or a `.sh` file.
```bash
export HELIUS_API_KEY=''
export SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=''
export DISCORD_TOKEN=''
export BIRD_EYE=''
export DEX=''
export DB_NAME=""
export DB_HOST=""
export DB_PORT=
export DB_USER=""
export DB_PASSWORD=""
```


## Installation  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AintSmurf/Automated-Solana-Sniper-Bot/.git
cd Automated-Solana-Sniper-Bot/
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python .\bot_scripts\db_initializer.py  #DB creation
```
## Running the Bot

The bot can be launched in three main modes: UI, CLI, and Server.

On the first run, it will also prompt you to choose your preferred mode and configure settings.

---


### First Run (No bot_settings.json yet)

```bash
python main.py 
```

- When you run the bot for the first time:
  ```
  First run detected ‚Äî launch with graphical UI? (y/N):
  ```
  - If you choose yes ‚Üí the tkinter UI will open
  - If you choose no ‚Üí the bot runs in CLI mode and will also prompt you for initial settings (e.g., liquidity, trade amount, thresholds)
  - Your answers will be saved to bot_settings.json (unless you pass --no-save)
---
### UI Mode (Graphical Interface)

```bash
python main.py --ui
```

- Forces the bot to run in the terminal only, ignoring UI settings
- Useful for configuration and live monitoring
- **Recommended** for beginners or for manual supervision of the bot

---

### CLI Mode (Interactive Terminal)

```bash
python main.py --cli
```

- Forces the bot to run in the terminal only, ignoring UI settings
- Displays logs, buys, and sells in real time
- Sends alerts to Discord (if configured)
---

### Server Mode (Headless / No Prompts)

```bash
python main.py --s or python main.py --server 
```

- Runs in headless CLI mode with zero prompts, even on first run
- Uses whatever is saved in bot_settings.json
- Ideal for **cloud servers, VPS, or Docker containers**
- Auto-shutdown happens after `MAXIMUM_TRADES` is reached unless customized.
- If bot_settings.json does not exist, a new one will be created using default settings

---

### Temporary Overrides (Without Saving)

```bash
python main.py --ui --no-save
```

- Launches in UI mode just for this run, but does not overwrite the saved UI_MODE in bot_settings.json
- Works with --ui, --cli

---

## Configuration

```python
{
    #Solana blockchain mainnet- real, devnet-development/test network
    "NETWORK":"mainnet"
    
    # Whether to run the bot with a UI (tkinter dashboard)
    "UI_MODE": False,

    "MIN_TOKEN_LIQUIDITY": 10000,

    # Maximum token age (in seconds) to be considered "fresh"
    "MAX_TOKEN_AGE_SECONDS": 30,

    # Amount (in USD) per trade (simulation or real)
    "TRADE_AMOUNT": 10,

    # Max number of trades before the bot shuts down

    # Take profit and stop loss rules
    "SLPG": 3.0,                      # SLPG is a percent expressed as a float (e.g. 3.0 = 3%). The bot converts SLPG ‚Üí slippageBps for Jupiter by int(SLPG * 100) (so 3.0 ‚Üí 300 bps).
    "TP": 4.0,                        # +300% (4x entry)

            "max_requests_per_minute": None,  # unlimited
            "name": "Helius_limits"
        },
        "jupiter": {
            "min_interval": 1.1,              # seconds between requests

        }
    }
}

```

##  Docker Setup 
- You can run the bot inside Docker using the provided **Dockerfile.bot**
  - Configure credentials in Credentials.sh (or use environment variables)
  ```env
    HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_api_key
    SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_private_key 
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token 
    BIRD_EYE_API_KEY=your_birdeye_key (optional)
    DEX="Pumpfun" or "Raydium"
    ```
  - Prepare settings
    Since Docker runs the bot with the --s (server) flag, there are no prompts.
    Make sure a valid bot_settings.json is already present in your project.
      - If bot_settings.json is missing, Docker will create one with default settings.
      - It‚Äôs recommended to configure it locally first and then mount it into the container.
  - Build the Docker image
    ```bash
    docker build -f Dockerfile.bot -t solana-sniper-bot
    ```
  - Step 3: Run the bot inside Docker
    ```bash
    docker run solana-sniper-bot
    ```

## Roadmap

- **Backup Price Source (Birdeye / on chain / - fallback, added but not fully integrated)** ‚Äî Secondary price feeds to ensure reliability when Jupiter or Helius rates fail.  

- **Volume Tracking (beta)** ‚Äî Tracks USD inflows/outflows per token to identify hype and unusual activity.  
  - Currently saves snapshots but accuracy still needs improvement.  

- **Blacklist / Whitelist automated detection (planned)** ‚Äî Automatically flags suspicious tokens or prioritizes trusted ones.  
  - Integrated into detection and exit rule checks.    

- **Telegram Notifications (planned)** ‚Äî Send trade alerts, errors, and detection events to Telegram channels.  

- **Slack Notifications (planned)** ‚Äî Push alerts and trading activity into Slack workspaces.  

- **Web Dashboard (planned)** ‚Äî A lightweight web UI for remote monitoring and control.  
  - Real-time feeds: detection events, open positions, closed positions, and logs.  
  - Live charts for PnL and token price history.  
  - Remote controls: start/stop bot, trigger manual sell, adjust trading settings.  

- **Track tokens by address (planned)** ‚Äî Add tokens to a watchlist by mint address (manual or via detection).  
  - Watchlist supports per-token overrides (custom TP/SL, trade size, whitelist/blacklist).  
  - Watchlist shown in UI and accessible from the web dashboard or CLI.  
- **Automated Tests (pytest)** ‚Äî unit and integration tests for buy/sell flows, volume tracking, and context initialization.



## Log Management

Logs are organized for clarity and traceability:
| File                             | Description                              |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `logs/info.log`                  | General info/debug logs                  |
| `logs/debug.log`                 | Developer-focused debug logs             |
| `logs/console_logs/console.info` | Simplified console view                  |
| `logs/special_debug.log`         | Critical debug logs (e.g. scam analysis) |

---

## Log Summarization Tool

This tool allows you to extract, clean, and analyze logs for one or multiple token addresses and transaction signatures.

###  Functionality

- Searches across:
  - `logs/debug/`
  - `logs/backup/debug/`
  - `logs/info.log`
- Matches logs by:
  - `--signature` (transaction signature)
  - `--token` (mint address)
- Removes duplicate or overlapping lines
- Sorts all matched logs chronologically
- Outputs a clean, consolidated log to: logs/matched_logs/<token_address>.log
### Manual Usage (One Token)
To analyze a **single** token and transaction:

```bash
python bot_scripts/analyze.py --signature <txn_signature> --token <token_address>
```
To analyze all tokens in parallel from your results:

```bash
python bot_scripts/run_analyze.py 
```
- explanation
  - Reads results/tokens/all_tokens_found.csv
  - Extracts logs for each Signature and Token Mint pair
  - Runs `analyze.py` in parallel subprocesses 
    - (uses `max_workers=10` by default; 
    - actual concurrency depends on your CPU)
